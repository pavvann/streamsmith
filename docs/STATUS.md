# STATUS

## Sept 9 (IST night)
- Done: repo scaffold, TASKS.md, AI-USAGE, feedback stubs. Plan v2 approved (docs/PROJECT.md). Bazantic dropped; two sponsors.
- Running: A1 toolchain + Pinax build + local ClickHouse + sink; A2 contract + facts + vault resolution; A3 Privy facts + Vaultpilot server skeleton.
- Blocked on Pawan: GitHub push, `substreams auth`, Privy app keys, Base wallet funding, ClickHouse Cloud (not needed until hosted-sink spike).
- A1 done: toolchain installed and pinned; Pinax repo cloned, prebuilt erc4626 spkg usable; own builds and Docker BLOCKED by full disk (1.6 GB free). Pinax erc4626 not on substreams.dev → import by pinned raw-GitHub URL. from-proto ClickHouse needs schema annotations in our proto (forwarded to A2).
- Decision: ClickHouse Cloud is the dev+demo database (Docker off the critical path). Disk cleanup needs Pawan's approval.
